    HealthHack is a product-building event that runs from a Friday evening through to Sunday. Teams work on problems that have been submitted by Problem Owners - typically medical researchers, medical organisations, hospitals or governmentâ€” but they could come from anyone who has a health-related problem they want to solve. The HealthHack kicks off on Friday 24th October at 6pm and continues all day and night on Saturday 25th concluding in the evening on Sunday 26th. Festivities wrap up on the Sunday at 4pm with judging and prizes.
