		"description" : "My proposition for the HealthHack is to build a prototype of a tool which will allow to draw pedigree charts and export the drawn information in a standard file format. The tool should be easy to use and also easy to integrate into existing frameworks. There are a number of existing pedigree drawing open source projects but none of them offer the functionality described above. Maybe we can hack some of those into doing what we need.",
