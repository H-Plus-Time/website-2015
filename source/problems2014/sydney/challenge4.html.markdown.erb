#### The problem
We find ourselves in the era of personalised medicine, in part due to amazing advances in DNA sequencing technology. Using this technology, we aim to improve patient healthcare, through improved diagnosis, and tailoring treatments to match the unique genetic makeup of a patient. The problem is that the analytical pipelines to go from raw sequencing data to medically actionable information are complex, and consist of dozens of software components and databases. We’d like to be able to integrate, visualise and interpret the information that the sequencing pipelines generate in real-time, to substantially improve data quality & prevent poor data being used to guide clinical decision making.

#### The dream
We would love to develop a genome pipeline visualisation platform, which tracked and monitored NGS analysis pipelines in real-time, presenting the key metrics at each stage of the process to the analysts, via informative visualisations. This would aggregate and compare data over time, so that deviations can be easily identified. It would cross reference the metrics and meta-data associated with each sample, so that anomalies could be tracked back to a bad batch of reagents, a particular sequencing machine, or a particular operator for instance.

#### The hack
We would love to build a solution to import the metrics from key steps of the sequencing analysis pipeline, ingest these metrics into a database, and visualise these in an interactive fashion. We already have code for parsing most of the metrics, and a data-model for tracking the relationships between objects (like sequencing runs and samples). We are missing the bits that harvest this information in real-time, ingest into a database, and visualise this information; to this end, we have been considering building our own D3-based visualisation platform, or perhaps configuring a fluentd, splunk or tableau platform.

#### The future
We see clinical genomics becoming a mainstream part of healthcare, where for babies with inherited genetic diseases, or patients with cancer, it will make more sense to sequence a patient’s genome & use this information to guide improved healthcare. As we scale up to reach tens of thousands of patients per year, this platform will become an indispensible piece of the clinical genomics puzzle.
