#### The problem

The human reference genome has been sequenced more than a decade ago but to this date the insight into the function of any particular segment of the genome sequence is very limited. Fortunately, recent technological advances provide biological research and life sciences with an incredible set of new tools that enables us to modify single genomic positions with high accuracy and observe the effects of these perturbations on cellular processes thus providing insight on how life functions on the molecular and cellular level.

There is two sides to this coin though. On one hand, a genome modification should be introduced with high efficiency at the targeted side of interest. On the other hand, genomic positions that have a very similar DNA sequence will also attract the modification. Such off-targets need to be avoided as much as possible in order to guarantee a clean experimental outcome.

Most of the time the best target site will not comply with both objective functions simultaneously, i.e. maximal on-target efficiency and minimal off-target abundance, thus requiring a compromise between the two. This compromise will be depend on the application at hand.

#### The dream

The dream is to provide a web-app that allows life scientist to select the target site for their gene of interest and tune the compromise between on-target efficiency and off-targets risk as required for the application at hand.

Such an online-tool would facilitate genome science with optimal accuracy, precision and efficiency.

#### The status

A prototype for genome analysis is currently under development. It's output comprises of a rich data set that contains a set of candidate target sites within the genomic region of interest, as well as a set of putative off-targets for each candidate all of which come with their own predicted efficiencies. In addition all regions will be annotated with known functional elements such as genes. These tasks are computationally demanding and will run on a High Performance Compute (HPC) cluster. Resulting output files will be either in plain text or Json format.

Examples on how such data might look like can be found at <a href="http://bioinformatics.org.au/tools/triplexator/inspector/example.html" target="_blank">http://bioinformatics.org.au/tools/triplexator/inspector/example.html</a>

#### The hack

The challenge is to guide scientist through the steps of designing their experiment and choosing their optimal genomic target. Off-target search will be done on a HPC cluster. The multidimensional output then needs to be collated and presented in a clean, slick and functional web-frontend indicating the pro and cons of each candidate.

#### How this helps us

Precise genome editing is changing the way of how biomedical science is performed. It is increasingly the focus of scientific discussion, e.g. at a recent <a href="http://www.genome-engineering.com.au/" target="_blank">Symposium in Melbourne</a>. Precise genome editing not just enables insights into cellular behavior, it also provides new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of heritable diseases as well as Cancer, Alzheimer and many more. Most importantly, a web-app that facilitates the intuitive design and assessment of genome editing tools is a prerequisite to achieve the precision, accuracy and efficiency gene therapy demands.
